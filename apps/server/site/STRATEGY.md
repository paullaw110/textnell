# Nell — Content Strategy

---

## 1. Target Audience Personas

### Maya, 33 — "The Overwhelmed Connector"
Product designer at a mid-size tech company. Lives in Denver with her partner and a 2-year-old. Has a wide friend circle from college, grad school, and two previous cities. She's the one who used to organize everything — birthday dinners, group trips, holiday cards. Since becoming a parent, she's dropped almost all of it. She still *cares* deeply but has zero bandwidth. Last month she realized she missed her best friend's birthday by a week. She texted "omg I'm the worst" and hated herself for three days.

**Tech comfort:** High. But app fatigue is real — she's deleted three "life organization" apps this year.
**Key emotion:** Guilt. She feels like she's failing the people she loves.

### Darius, 38 — "The Intentional Professional"
Runs a small creative agency. 15 close friends, a big family scattered across four states, and a girlfriend whose parents' names he keeps forgetting. He *wants* to be the guy who sends the perfect birthday text, remembers that his buddy's kid just started kindergarten, shows up with a bottle of wine that actually matches someone's taste. He's tried Clay, tried a spreadsheet, tried setting calendar reminders. Nothing sticks because he never checks the thing.

**Tech comfort:** High, but skeptical of "AI" branding.
**Key emotion:** Aspiration. He wants to be effortlessly thoughtful.

### Janelle, 29 — "The Friend Group Glue"
Account manager. The group chat admin. She tracks who's going through what, who needs a check-in, who's about to have a baby. She does it all in her head and it's exhausting. She doesn't need a CRM — she needs a second brain that pings her when it matters.

**Tech comfort:** Moderate. Lives in iMessage. Doesn't want another app.
**Key emotion:** Relief. She wants something that shares the load.

## 2. Pain Points (Emotional, Not Functional)

| Surface Pain | Emotional Consequence |
|---|---|
| Forgot a birthday | "I'm a terrible friend. They probably noticed." |
| Haven't checked in on someone going through something | "I said I'd be there and I wasn't." |
| Don't know what gift to buy | Panic-buying a gift card. Feeling generic. |
| Lost touch with someone who mattered | "We used to be so close. Now it'd be weird to reach out." |
| Carrying everyone's dates/details in your head | Mental load exhaustion, especially for women and "connector" personality types |
| Set up a CRM/app and never opened it again | "I wasted time on another system that didn't work." |

## 3. Desire Matrix

| What They Want to Feel | What They Want to Be | What They Want to Do |
|---|---|---|
| Thoughtful without effort | "The friend who always remembers" | Text the perfect thing at the right time |
| In control of relationships | Someone who nurtures, not neglects | Send a gift that actually lands |
| Less guilty | Present, even when busy | Stay close to people across distance/time |
| Lighter (less mental load) | Effortlessly caring | Not have to maintain a system |

## 4. Positioning Statement

**For people who care deeply about their relationships but can't keep track of everything**, Nell is a friendly AI you text — she remembers the details, reminds you at the right moment, and helps you show up for your people. No app. No effort. Just better relationships.

### Category
SMS-first personal relationship manager.

### One-liner
"Text Nell about your people. She'll make sure you never drop the ball."

## 5. Voice & Tone Guide

### Nell's Personality
Nell is your most organized friend — the one who somehow always remembers your mom's birthday and has a gift idea ready. She's warm, a little cheeky, and never judgmental. She doesn't lecture you for forgetting. She just helps.

### Voice Attributes
- **Warm** — like a text from a close friend, not a notification from an app
- **Casual but not sloppy** — contractions, conversational rhythm, but clear
- **Slightly cheeky** — a wink, not a wisecrack. Light humor, never forced
- **Direct** — short sentences. Says what she means.
- **Encouraging** — "you've got this" energy, never guilt-trippy

### Words We Use
- People, friends, family, your people
- Remember, remind, nudge
- Thoughtful, close, connected
- Text, message, chat
- Simple, easy, no effort

### Words We Avoid
- Network, networking, connections (too LinkedIn)
- CRM, contacts, manage (too corporate)
- Unlock, harness, leverage, revolutionize (AI slop)
- Optimize, maximize, hack (growth-bro energy)
- Platform, solution, tool (SaaS speak)

### Emoji Use
Occasional. One per message max in Nell's SMS voice. On the website, use sparingly — in feature cards, not headlines.

## 6. Key Differentiators vs. Competition

| Differentiator | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **SMS-first (no app)** | Solves the #1 problem: "I set it up and never opened it again." Nell comes to you. |
| **AI that acts, not just informs** | Competitors say "call Sarah." Nell says "Sarah's birthday is Friday. She's been into hiking lately. Want me to draft something?" |
| **Personal relationships, not networking** | Not LinkedIn. Not for sales pipelines. For being a better friend/partner/family member. |
| **Gift intelligence** | Nobody else does this. Contextual gift suggestions based on what you've told Nell about someone. |
| **Zero setup, zero habit required** | Text a number. Done. No account creation, no importing contacts, no weekly reviews. |

## 7. Conversion Strategy

### Primary CTA: Text (279) 529-0731
The phone number IS the conversion. Every section should funnel toward texting Nell. The CTA button should trigger `sms:+12795290731` on mobile.

### Secondary CTA: Web Chat
Link to nell.superlandings.io/chat for desktop users or people who want to try before texting. Lower commitment. Frame as "Try Nell in your browser."

### Conversion Flow
1. **Arrive on page** → Understand what Nell does in <5 seconds (hero)
2. **See it in action** → Mock SMS conversation shows the product being delightful
3. **Understand the model** → 3-step "how it works" removes uncertainty
4. **Feel the difference** → "No app needed" section hits the pain of app fatigue
5. **See themselves** → Use case personas create recognition
6. **No risk** → "Free during early access" removes price objection
7. **Act** → Text the number or try web chat

### Key Metrics to Track
- SMS messages received (primary conversion)
- Web chat sessions started (secondary)
- Scroll depth (are people reaching the CTA sections?)
- Time on page
- Phone number clicks (mobile)

## 8. Content Notes for Design Team

### Visual Direction
- **Warm, illustrated, personality-driven** — reference Cleo and Callbaba
- **Coral/peach/warm tones** — NOT dark mode, NOT corporate blue
- **Hand-drawn illustration style** — friendly, approachable, slightly whimsical
- **SMS conversation mockups** — the hero visual. Should feel like looking at a real phone screen
- **Mobile-first design** — the product IS mobile. The site should feel that way too.

### Anti-Patterns
- No stock photos of people laughing at laptops
- No dark gradient hero sections
- No "AI" imagery (no neural networks, no robot heads)
- No feature comparison tables on the landing page
- No multi-step signup forms
