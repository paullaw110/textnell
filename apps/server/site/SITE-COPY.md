# Nell — Site Copy (textnell.com)

Full section-by-section copy for a single-page landing site.

## Nav

- **Logo:** Nell (wordmark, warm typeface)
- **CTA Button:** "Text Nell →" (links to `sms:+12795290731`)

## Hero

### Headline
**Never forget the people who matter.**

### Subheadline
Nell is a friendly AI you text. Tell her about your people — she'll remind you before birthdays, suggest the perfect gift, and help you show up when it counts.

### Primary CTA
**📱 Text Nell: (279) 529-0731**
Button: "Send a text →" → `sms:+12795290731`

### Secondary CTA
"Or try Nell in your browser →" → nell.superlandings.io/chat

### Visual Note
*Hero visual: illustrated phone showing an SMS conversation with Nell. Warm background (peach/coral gradient). The phone should feel real but the surrounding illustration should be hand-drawn/whimsical — à la Callbaba. Cleo-style bold typography for the headline.*

---

## Social Proof / Trust Bar

> "Nell reminded me about my best friend's birthday AND suggested a gift she actually loved. I looked like a hero." — Early access user

**Trust indicators (horizontal bar):**
- 🎂 500+ birthdays remembered *(update with real number)*
- 💬 SMS-first — no app needed
- 🔒 Your data stays private
- ✨ Free during early access

### Content Note
*These numbers are aspirational for launch. Flag for Paul: when do we have real usage stats to swap in? Even "100+ people in early access" works if accurate.*

## Product Demo: Nell in Action

### Section Headline
**See how Nell works. (It's just texting.)**

### Mock SMS Conversation

Display as a realistic iMessage-style conversation thread:

**You:** Hey Nell, my friend Sarah's birthday is March 15. She's really into hiking and just got a new puppy.

**Nell:** Got it! 🎂 I'll remember Sarah — March 15, loves hiking, new puppy parent. I'll text you a few days before with gift ideas. Anything else about her?

**You:** She drinks oat milk lattes and just moved to Portland.

**Nell:** Updated! Sarah sounds great. I'll make sure you're ready for her birthday.

*— Two weeks later —*

**Nell:** Hey! Sarah's birthday is in 3 days (Saturday). Here are some gift ideas based on what you've told me:

🥾 **Darn Tough hiking socks** — $25, lifetime warranty, she'll actually use them
🐕 **Wild One dog carrier bag** — $65, perfect for trail hikes with the new pup
☕ **Fellow Carter mug** — $35, keeps oat milk lattes hot forever

Want me to draft a birthday message for her too?

**You:** Yes! Something casual.

**Nell:** How about: "Happy birthday Sarah!! 🎉 Hope Portland is treating you well. How's the puppy adjusting? We need to plan a hike soon." — Send as-is, or want me to tweak it?

### Visual Note
*This should be the centerpiece of the page. Design it as an actual phone screen with the conversation scrolling. Consider animating it — messages appearing one by one as you scroll. Reference Cleo's approach of showing the product in action on the landing page, but adapted for SMS instead of app UI.*

### Below the conversation
**That's it. You texted. Nell remembered. You showed up.**
Button: "Try it yourself →" → `sms:+12795290731`

## How It Works

### Section Headline
**Three texts. That's the whole setup.**

### Step 1
**Tell Nell about your people.**
Text her a name, a birthday, what they're into — whatever you know. She'll remember all of it.

*Illustration note: simple icon of a chat bubble with a heart or person silhouette*

### Step 2
**Nell does the remembering.**
Before birthdays, anniversaries, or just when it's been a while — Nell texts you with context and ideas.

*Illustration note: calendar with a friendly notification/nudge*

### Step 3
**You show up like a great friend.**
With gift suggestions, message drafts, and the details you'd forgotten. Zero effort, maximum thoughtfulness.

*Illustration note: gift box or two people hugging / high-fiving — illustrated, warm*

## Features Grid

### Section Headline
**Everything a thoughtful friend would do.**

#### 🎂 Birthday & Date Reminders
Never miss another birthday, anniversary, or important date. Nell texts you a few days ahead — with context, not just a name.

#### 🎁 Gift Suggestions
Personalized gift ideas based on what you've told Nell about someone. Budget-friendly, actually thoughtful. No generic gift cards.

#### ✍️ Message Drafts
Stuck on what to say? Nell drafts birthday messages, check-in texts, and "thinking of you" notes that sound like you, not a robot.

#### 🧠 Relationship Memory
Nell remembers the details — new jobs, new pets, food allergies, inside jokes. So you don't have to keep it all in your head.

#### 📱 SMS-First
No app to download. No account to create. Just text (279) 529-0731 and start talking.

#### 🔮 Smart Check-In Nudges *(Coming Soon)*
Nell will notice when you haven't connected with someone in a while and give you a gentle nudge — with a reason to reach out.

## The Nell Difference

### Section Headline
**You don't need another app.**

### Body Copy
You've downloaded the productivity app. The habit tracker. The personal CRM. They all worked great for about a week.

The problem was never the app. It was that you had to *open* it.

Nell lives in your text messages — the one app you already check 80 times a day. She doesn't need you to build a new habit. She just shows up when it matters.

### Stats Row

| SMS | Email | App Notification |
|---|---|---|
| **98%** open rate | 20% open rate | 40% open rate |
| **90%** read within 3 min | 5% read within 3 min | 30% read within 3 min |
| **No download** needed | — | Requires install + habit |

### Closing Line
**Nell doesn't compete for your attention. She earns it by being useful exactly when you need her.**

### Visual Note
*Consider a split illustration: left side shows a phone home screen with 47 unread app notifications (overwhelm). Right side shows a single friendly text from Nell (clarity). Cleo does something similar with their "before/after" approach.*

---

## Use Cases: Who Nell Is For

### Section Headline
**For anyone who cares but can't keep track.**

---

### 🏃 The Busy Professional
You're crushing it at work. But last week you realized you haven't called your mom in a month, your college roommate had a baby and you still haven't sent anything, and your partner's parents' anniversary is... soon?

**Nell helps:** Keeps track of the people and dates so your career doesn't cost you your relationships.

---

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 The Family Connector
Your family is spread across three time zones. You're the one who remembers everyone's birthdays, coordinates holiday plans, and knows that Uncle Rick is lactose intolerant. It's a lot.

**Nell helps:** Shares the mental load. Reminds you before dates, suggests gifts, and keeps track of everyone's stuff so it's not all in your head.

---

### 🎉 The Friend Group Organizer
You're the group chat MVP. You plan the dinners, remember who's going through a breakup, and somehow know everyone's dietary restrictions. Your friends love you. Your brain is tired.

**Nell helps:** Like having a co-organizer who never forgets a detail.

---

### 💕 The Long-Distance Partner/Friend
You care deeply about people who aren't in your daily life. Old friends, long-distance family, the college crew you only see once a year. You *mean* to stay in touch. Life gets in the way.

**Nell helps:** Nudges you to reach out with something specific to say — not just "hey, how are you?" but "hey, how'd that job interview go?"

---

## Pricing

### Section Headline
**Free. Seriously.**

### Body
Nell is in early access and completely free right now. Text her, try her out, tell her about your people. No credit card. No catch.

Eventually we'll introduce a paid plan ($9-19/mo) for power users — but early adopters get to shape what Nell becomes.

### CTA
"Join early access — text Nell now →" → `sms:+12795290731`

### Content Note
*Flag for Paul: Confirm pricing range. Do early access users get locked in at a lower rate? Grandfather clause? This could be a strong conversion hook: "Get in free now, keep a discount forever."*

## FAQ

### How much does Nell cost?
Free during early access. We'll eventually introduce paid plans, but we'll always give you plenty of notice.

### How does Nell work?
You text Nell at (279) 529-0731 like you'd text a friend. Tell her about the people in your life — birthdays, interests, important dates. She remembers everything and texts you reminders, gift ideas, and message drafts when the time is right.

### Is my data private?
Yes. We don't sell your data. We don't share it. The information you tell Nell about your relationships is used only to help *you* be a better friend. We take this seriously.

### Do I need to download an app?
Nope. Nell works entirely over SMS. If you'd prefer a browser experience, you can also chat with her at [nell.superlandings.io/chat](https://nell.superlandings.io/chat).

### What if I want to stop?
Text "STOP" to Nell anytime. No hard feelings. Your data will be deleted.

### Can Nell text my friends for me?
Not directly — Nell texts *you* with reminders and drafts. You're still the one sending the birthday text or buying the gift. Nell just makes sure you don't forget and gives you something great to say.

### How does Nell suggest gifts?
Based on what you've told her about someone — their interests, hobbies, and what's going on in their life. Nell suggests real products at real prices. Some links may be affiliate links, but recommendations are never influenced by commissions. If it's not a good gift, Nell won't suggest it.

## Content Notes & Design Guidance

### Illustrations
- **Hero:** Phone with SMS conversation, warm illustrated background (Callbaba style)
- **Product Demo:** Realistic phone screen with scrolling/animated conversation
- **How It Works:** Three simple spot illustrations (chat bubble, calendar, gift)
- **Features:** Emoji icons are fine, or custom illustrated icons in the warm palette
- **Nell Difference:** Split-screen illustration — app chaos vs. one calm text
- **Use Cases:** Small character illustrations for each persona (diverse, contemporary)
- **Final CTA:** Constellation of connected people, or large phone number as hero graphic

### Cleo References
- **Product Demo section:** Cleo shows their chat UI prominently on the landing page. Nell should do the same with SMS.
- **Personality throughout:** Cleo's copy has attitude. Nell should too — warm rather than snarky, but with personality.
- **Bold typography:** Cleo uses oversized, playful headlines. Adopt similar approach.

### Needs Paul's Input
- [ ] Exact pricing tiers and whether early access users get grandfathered
- [ ] Real usage stats for trust bar (or approval of aspirational numbers)
- [ ] Privacy policy and terms — need to be created
- [ ] Contact email for footer
- [ ] Whether "coming soon" features should be listed or held back
- [ ] Gift affiliate disclosure language — legal review needed?
- [ ] Confirm web chat URL is correct and live
