Review all recent changes (check git diff and recent commits) and update the project documentation:

1. Add entries to docs/changelog.md for any undocumented changes
2. Update docs/project-status.md with current progress and a 'where we left off' summary
3. Update docs/architecture.md if there were any structural changes
4. Create or update any relevant feature reference docs in docs/references/
5. Commit the documentation updates with the message 'docs: update project documentation'
